Al-Insaan Care: A Supportive App for Illiterate Needy People

Al-Insaan Care is a mobile application specifically designed to bridge the accessibility gap for illiterate and needy individuals. By removing traditional text-based barriers, the platform empowers users to request and receive essential financial aid and material donations—including food, clothing, electronics, and blood—with dignity and ease.


## Project Overview

The primary goal of Al-Insaan Care is to provide an inclusive, user-friendly experience for populations that struggle with literacy. The application leverages multimedia tools to ensure that navigating the path to assistance is as intuitive as possible.


### Key Features

Accessibility-First Design: Information is presented through visuals, audio instructions, and videos rather than text.


Voice-Activated Requests: Users can submit vital information (CNIC, address, house details) via voice messages or direct calls.


Thorough Verification: An administrative department validates all requests to ensure aid reaches those truly in need.


Streamlined Distribution: Integrated delivery services handle the distribution of material goods, while money and blood are managed through direct channels.


Social & Community Engagement: A social feed allows for community interaction and updates on humanitarian efforts.


## UI & User Experience

The interface is designed to be clean and minimalist, focusing on high-contrast iconography and simple workflows.

### Main Components
